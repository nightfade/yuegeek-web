                He spent most of his childhood drawing and painting.
                He ventured into the digital world by earning a degree in computer science and business.

                high-tech and aesthetically superb design. When he is not running Littlelines like a pro,
                he loves living in Seattle with his gal, listening to his vinyl record collection,
                and taking in the occasional beach.</p>
